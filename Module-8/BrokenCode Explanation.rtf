\f0\fs24 \cf0 So at first I was reallyy frustrated because my code in the javascript and html files seemed to be correct but the buttons still weren\'92t working. I then realized it was because the .js file wasn\'92t linked to my html file correctly! When I linked my \'93logic.js\'94 the buttons worked. I also noticed for the click functions, \'93click\'94 did not have the quotations in multiple spots so I added those quotations. Re-formatting the code also made it easier for me to compare the code side by side and identity the discrepancies. }
